# Axe-detector
 
The repository contains solution for a computer vision problem which contains following steps;

1. Select a region by pointing out four corner points.
2. The model will do the predictions and draw a bounding box on the axe, as it is moving towards the target.

In this way we can use it, to find the coordinates of the axe on target or our specified region.

Here I used a video as our dataset, but you customize it and make a real time detection system.

## Note
